# A modern, browser-based frontend to gdb (gnu debugger)

Add breakpoints, view stack traces, and more in C, C++, Go, and Rust! Perfect 
for beginners and experts. Simply run `gdbgui` from the terminal and a new tab 
will open in your browser.

# Fork
[Note: this is a fork of gdbgui](https://github.com/cs01/gdbgui)

If you want the easy pip install, use that one. Otherwise, build this one from
source and get the pretty GUI. I maintaining this as a fork because the GUI
regressions after the refactor from the origin were too much to handle. It's mostly for
my own personal enjoyment, anyway. I hope you like it.
